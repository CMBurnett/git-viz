## 3. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| GitHub API changes | Low | High | Keep up with GitHub API documentation, build in version checking |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Implement data pagination, optimize rendering |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | High | Regular security audits, keep dependencies updated |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Cross-browser testing, use of polyfills if necessary |

## 4. Team Responsibilities
