# Project Notes

## Overview

## Goals and Objectives

To create a GitHub Contribution map component with options, purely with AI (in this case Claude), for use by other Designers and Engineers.

## Notes along the way
- took ~4hrs for; prompting, project setup, initial commit, debugging (maybe 30mins) to get to the initial functioning state
- took about another ~1hr to adjust the grid to a row-based grid, fix the contribution-levles and matching color scheme and remove the heatmap view
- this initial functioning state had some style and good motion to it, but there was XXhrs in styling the component to my liking in Tailwind
- I'll need to spend some time cleaning up the main page for publishing this publicly available component
- I'll also need to spend some time breaking out the stats and map from the page, so we can use them indepenently from the repo main page
